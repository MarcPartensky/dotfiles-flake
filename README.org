* Install NixOS with ZFS as root filesystem
This repo contains a minimal set of configuration for installing
NixOS, using [[https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/][ZFS]] as root filesystem.

ZFS is a modern filesystem with many features such as snapshot,
self-healing and pooled storage.

To use this repo, see [[https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/NixOS/Root%20on%20ZFS.html][Documentation]].

Upon initial installation, only the bootloader, mountpoints and root
password is configured. Refer to =man configuration.nix= for available
options. You can search for available packages with [[https://search.nixos.org/packages][Package Search]];
search for options with [[https://search.nixos.org/options][Option Search]].

[[https://codeberg.org/m0p/dotfiles][My personal dotfiles repo]] contains an instance of desktop
configuration based on sway, tmux and Emacs.
